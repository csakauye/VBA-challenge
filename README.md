Module 2 Weekly Challenge  
  
Hello!
  
I've included three screenshots for each sheet of the multiple_year_stock_data Excel file. Additionally, I have two VBA codes in my repo.   
  
"stocks_ws" is the first portion of the challenge. It includes the creation of the ticker summary table with ticker name, yearly/percent change and total stock volume.  
  
I was able to pull the ticker name and total stock volume relatively easily from the class content. The yearly and percent change took me a few tries before I was able to get it. I created it initially in a separate sub-routine in the alphabetical_testing file and then added it in to my code after I had already coded out the easier parts.   
  
The conditional formatting of the table is included in "stocks_ws" at the end.  
  
My second VBA code is "greatest_ws." This holds the code to calculate the greatest percent increase, decrease and greatest total volume.  
  
Thanks!
